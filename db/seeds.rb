Whole families\nshopping at night!  Aisles full of husbands!  Wives in the\navocados, babies in the tomatoes!--and you, Garcia Lorca, what\nwere you doing down by the watermelons?\n\nI saw you, Walt Whitman, childless, lonely old grubber,\npoking among the meats in the refrigerator and eyeing the grocery boys.\nI heard you asking questions of each: Who killed the\npork chops?  What price bananas?  Are you my Angel?\nI wandered in and out of the brilliant stacks of cans\nfollowing you, and followed in my imagination by the store detective.\nWe strode down the open corridors together in our\nsolitary fancy tasting artichokes, possessing every frozen\ndelicacy, and never passing the cashier.\n\nWhere are we going, Walt Whitman?  The doors close in\nan hour.  Which way does your beard point tonight?\n(I touch your book and dream of our odyssey in the\nsupermarket and feel absurd.)\nWill we walk all night through solitary streets?  The\ntrees add shade to shade, lights out in the houses, we'll both be lonely.\n\nWill we stroll dreaming of the lost America of love\npast blue automobiles in driveways, home to our silent cottage?\nAh, dear father, graybeard, lonely old courage-teacher,\nwhat America did you have when Charon quit poling his ferry and\nyou got out on a smoking bank and stood watching the boat\ndisappear on the black waters of Lethe?",
